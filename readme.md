# Maggie SCSS Library 

## Set Up

Run `npm install maggie-scss-lib --save-dev`

---

There are a few ways to incorporate in your project:

- provide the includePath option to node-sass or gulp-sass `node_modules/maggie-scss-lib/scss/` , then `import "maggie";`

- `import "./node_modules/maggie-scss-lib/scss/maggie";` at the top of your main imports file.

- just drop in or copy/paste our `_maggie.scss` file! Currently all mixins & functions are defined in that single file.


## Still improving
We are not even close to were we want to be yet. Still a bunch of mixins and variables to create to help improve your work flow. Will launch ASAP
